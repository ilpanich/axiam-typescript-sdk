## [1.0.0-alpha] - 2026-07-15

First alpha release of the official TypeScript client SDK for AXIAM. This is an
early, pre-production preview published to npm for evaluation and feedback — the
public API may still change before the beta and stable releases.

### Added

- REST client covering the AXIAM API surface (authentication, authorization
  checks, tenant/user/role/resource management).
- gRPC client (`@grpc/grpc-js`) for low-latency authorization checks; proto
  stubs are generated at build time and bundled, so consumers need no `buf`.
- Dual ESM/CJS builds with a browser-safe entry point (no Node-only transports
  leak into the browser bundle).
- Middleware helper for guarding server routes.
- Strict TLS by default with no certificate-verification bypass surface.
- Token-leak protection: no JWT-shaped values in built output.
- Fully documented public API (TSDoc) and published type declarations.
